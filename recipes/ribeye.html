        <h3>Description:</h3>

        <p>This <strong>amazing</strong> cut of beef is definitely a favorite and in my opinion, one of the most flavorful out there. There is no need for special or <em>fancy</em> ingredients, just steaks, seasonings, a brush of oil, and a pat of butter for perfection.</p>
    
        <h3>You are going to need:</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>300g fresh rib eye steak.</li>
            <li>Touch of olive oil.</li>
            <li>100g of butter.</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper for seasonings.</li>
            <li>Aromatics like: rosemary, thyme and garlic.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step by step guide:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Bring steaks to room temperature and season.</li>
            <li>Heat grill to medium heat. Season steaks and grill them between 5 to 7 minutes on each side, depending on the desired done-ness.</li>
